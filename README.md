stackr package
================

# Overview

The `stackr` package provides an easy way to combine predictions from
individual time series or panel data models to an ensemble. `stackr`
stacks Models according to the Continuous Ranked Probability Score
(CRPS) over k-step ahead predictions. It is therefore especially suited
for timeseries and panel data. A function for leave-one-out CRPS may be
added in the future. Predictions need to be predictive distributions
represented by predictive samples. Usually, these will be sets of
posterior predictive simulation draws generated by an MCMC algorithm.

# Installation

install using

``` r
devtools::install_github("epiforecasts/stackr")
```

# CRPS Stacking

Given some training data with true observed values as well as predictive
samples generated from different models, `stackr` finds the optimal (in
the sense of minimizing expected cross-validation predictive error)
weights to form an ensemble of these models. Using these weights, stackr
can then provide samples from the optimal model mixture by drawing from
the predictice samples of those models in the correct proportion. This
gives a mixture model solely based on predictive samples and is in this
regard superior to other ensembling techniques like Bayesian Model
Averaging. More information can be found in the package vignette.

Weights are generated using the `crps_weights` function. With these
weights and predictive samples, the `mixture_from_samples` function can
be used to obtain predictive samples from the optimal mixture model.

# Usage

## Load example data and split into train and test data

``` r
splitdate <- as.Date("2020-03-28")
data <- data.table::setDT(stackr::example_data)
traindata <- data[date <= splitdate]
testdata <- data[date > splitdate]
```

## Get weights and create mixture

``` r
weights <- stackr::crps_weights(traindata)
test_mixture <- stackr::mixture_from_samples(testdata, weights = weights)
```

## Score predictions

``` r
# combine data.frame with mixture with predictions from other models
score_df <- data.table::rbindlist(list(testdata, test_mixture), fill = TRUE)

# score all predictions using from github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils
score_df[, crps := scoringutils::crps(unique(y_obs), t(y_pred)),
        by = .(geography, model, date)]

# summarise scores
score_df[, mean(crps), by = model][, setnames(.SD, "V1", "CRPS")]
```
