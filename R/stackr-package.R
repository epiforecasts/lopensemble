#' The 'stackr' package.
#'
#' @description
#' The stackr package provides an easy way to stack models based on
#' the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) based on predictive samples.
#' Given some training data with true observed values as well as predictions
#' generated from different models, stackr finds the optimal weights to form an
#' ensemble from these models. Using these weights, stackr can then provide
#' samples from the optimal model mixture by drawing from the predictice samples
#' of those models in the correct proportion. This gives a true mixture model
#' solely based on predictive samples and is in this regard superior to other
#' ensembling techniques like Bayesian Model Averaging.
#'
#' Currently stacking using CRPS is supported. Weights are generated using
#' the \link{crps_weights} function. With these weights and predictive
#' samples, \link{mixture_from_samples} can be used to obtain predictive
#' samples from the optimal mixture model.
