#' @title Round vector elements while preserving the Sum
#'
#' @description
#' Round the real-valued elements of a vector in a way that the integers 
#' sum of the rounded elements equals the sum of the original elements. 
#' 
#' @details 
#' By default, the function implements the Largest-Remainder mehtod, also known as 
#' Hareâ€“Niemeyer method, Hamilton method or as Vinton's method. The procedure 
#' works by 1. Rounding everything down, 2. computing the difference between
#' the current and the desired sum and 3. adding one to elements in decreasing
#' order of their decimal parts. 
#' 
#' @param vector a vector with elements to be rounded to integers
#' @param type either 'LRM' or 'random' depending on whether the Largest-
#' Remainder method should be employed or whether there should be some 
#' randomness
#' 
#' @return returns the rounded version of the original input vector
