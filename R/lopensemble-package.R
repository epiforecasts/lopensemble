#' The 'lopensemble' package.
#'
#' @description
#' The lopensemble package provides an easy way to stack models based on the
#'   Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) based on predictive samples.
#'   Given some training data with true observed values as well as predictions
#'   generated from different models, lopensemble finds the optimal weights to
#'   form an ensemble from these models. Using these weights, lopensemble can
#'   then provide samples from the optimal model mixture by drawing from the
#'   predictice samples of those models in the correct proportion. This gives a
#'   true mixture model solely based on predictive samples and is in this regard
#'   superior to other ensembling techniques like Bayesian Model Averaging.
#'
#' Currently stacking using CRPS is supported. Weights are generated using the
#'   \link{crps_weights} function. With these weights and predictive samples,
#'   \link{mixture_from_samples} can be used to obtain predictive samples from
#'   the optimal mixture model.
