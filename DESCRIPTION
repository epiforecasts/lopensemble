Description: The stackr package provides an easy way to stack models based on 
    the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) based on predictive samples. 
    Given some training data with true observed values as well as predictions
    generated from different models, stackr finds the optimal weights to form an 
    ensemble from these models. Using these weights, stackr can then provide
    samples from the optimal model mixture by drawing from the predictice samples
    of those models in the correct proportion. This gives a true mixture model
    solely based on predictive samples and is in this regard superior to other 
    ensembling techniques like Bayesian Model Averaging.
