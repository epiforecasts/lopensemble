Description:
    Combines predictions from individual time series or panel data models
    into an ensemble using stacking (Yao, Vehtari, Simpson, and Gelman (2018)
    <doi:10.1214/17-BA1091>) based on the Continuous Ranked Probability Score
    (CRPS) (Gneiting and Raftery (2007) <doi:10.1198/016214506000001437>)
    over k-step ahead predictions. Predictions must be predictive distributions
    represented by samples, typically posterior predictive simulation draws
    from a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Given training data with
    observed values and predictive samples from different models, optimal
    stacking weights are computed to minimize expected cross-validation
    predictive error. These weights can then be used to generate samples from
    the mixture model by drawing from individual model predictions in the
    correct proportions.
