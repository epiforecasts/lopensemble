\title{Round vector elements while preserving the Sum}
\usage{
round_with_preserved_sum(vector, type = "LRM")
}
\arguments{
\item{vector}{a vector with elements to be rounded to integers}

\item{type}{either 'LRM' or 'random' depending on whether the Largest-
Remainder method should be employed or whether there should be some
randomness}
}
\value{
returns the rounded version of the original input vector
}
\description{
Round the real-valued elements of a vector in a way that the integers sum of
  the rounded elements equals the (rounded down) sum of the original
  elements.
}
\details{
By default, the function implements the Largest-Remainder mehtod, also known
  as Hareâ€“Niemeyer method, Hamilton method or as Vinton's method. The
  procedure works by 1. Rounding everything down, 2. computing the difference
  between the current and the desired sum and 3. adding one to elements in
  decreasing order of their decimal parts.
